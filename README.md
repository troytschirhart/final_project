    * Stock symbol
    * Number of shares owned

3. I, as a user, will be able edit my stock positions

4. I, as a user, will be able to delete my stock positions

5. I, as a user, will be able to view my portfolio summary, which will show
    * A list of stocks owned
        ** For each stock, it will show the stock symbol, shares owned, and value
    * A total portfolio value

2. Deployed online on Heroku
3. Fullstack CRUD app
    * Built using a MEAN stack
4. Authentication
